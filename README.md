# Palm/compute

A distributed compute application which currently includes an [Android client](/android) and a [Java server](/server). The
application wraps the [Lua/compute](https://github.com/emanuelpalm/lua-compute) library, which is a library for using Lua as
a compute engine.

*The application is to be regarded as a prototype, and is currently only finished enough to demonstrate that the Android client*
*is working. The server only sends bogus work to connected clients.*
